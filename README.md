# *Task 1 Software configuration*
## Subtask 1 Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?

Hi guys!

My name is Oleksandra, I have a technical education, but I have been working in sales for over 10 years. At the moment I am the head of the sales department, but for several years I have been going to change my profession and become a QA enginer. I think that the situation with the war in Ukraine finally pushed me to move from thinking to action. We no longer have time to put off our dreams.
I have already successfully completed two courses of manual testing, and still study some topics on my own. Participation in the **portfolio challenge** for me is an opportunity to strengthen my knowledge, learn new skills and increase my value for my future employer, becouse it`s no secret to anyone that it is difficult - to find the very first job :)

_Wish you all good luck!_
